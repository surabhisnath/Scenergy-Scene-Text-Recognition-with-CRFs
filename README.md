# Scenergy Scene Text Recognition with Conditional Random Fields

This work was done as part of project for the course Probabilistic Graphical Models. The work takes inspirationfrom the paper "Top-Down and Bottom-up Cues for Scene Text Recognition" by Anand Mishra et al. (CVPR 2015). Here, we try to extend the character-level idea presented in the paper to word-level scene text recognition.

The model is as given below:
